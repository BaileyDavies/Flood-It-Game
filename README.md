# Flood-It-Game
Flood It Android Game.

Personal project to create an android puzzle game using Java. 

# Features
Create a new game based on a set of user chosen parameters for game size and difficulty.

You have a limited amount of rounds to fill the board with the same color using the interactive color buttons. 

Don't reach the round limit without filling the board!

If you manage to beat the game, save your score using the game win popup.

Change the color of the theme for the game using the themes tab on the home screen. 

View your highscores using the highscore tab. 


# Code 
Flood-It uses the flood fill algorithm to update the game board. 

A local MySQL database is used to hold highscores locally.
